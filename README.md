# off-the-shelf-insect-identification
Main contribution of this repo is thorough evaluation of off-the-shelf approach for image classification based on a feature extraction with a single feed forward pass trough pretrained VGG16.

To run on your own dataset use stand alone script **feature_extraction_and_SVM.py** as described. It extracts features from all the images and performes SVM classification with 10fold cross validation
